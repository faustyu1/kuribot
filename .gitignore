# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the Python version is
#   often managed by the project itself or the user.
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#1181, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if you want to keep your development dependencies
#   separate from other users, uncomment the next line.
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
